  Flying Fig Farm is a woman-owned, family-operated farm, located on 4 acres of prime farmland in 
  Awendaw, SC. We believe growing our produce and plants locally with sustainable practices will 
  improve the health of our environment, pollinators and our community. Our farm specializes in 
  fruit trees and bushes, perennial vegetables, and native plants.
